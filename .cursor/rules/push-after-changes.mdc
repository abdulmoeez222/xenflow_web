# Push to GitHub After Changes

When you make any code or config changes in this project:

1. **Stage** all modified and new files (e.g. `git add` for the changed paths).
2. **Commit** with a short, descriptive message (e.g. "Booking: use Gmail port 465, add env note").
3. **Push** to the default branch: `git push origin main`.

Do this **without the user asking**. Push at the end of the same turn where you made the changes, when the changes are ready to go.

- Use `git status` first if unsure what changed.
- Request `git_write` and `network` permissions when running git commit/push.
- If there are no changes or nothing to push, skip the push step.
